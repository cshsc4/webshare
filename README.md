# Webshare Proxy Review 2026: Fast Speed, Affordable Pricing, 99.97% Uptime

Look, I'm not going to pretend I'm some proxy guru who's been doing this for decades. I'm just someone who's tried a bunch of proxy services and wants to tell you what actually works without all the marketing fluff.

So here's the deal with Webshare. It's a proxy service that's been around since 2018, and honestly? It's pretty solid for what you pay. They've got over 30 million IPs across 195 countries, which sounds impressive until you realize that's just table stakes these days. What actually matters is whether the damn things work.

## What Makes Webshare Different (Besides the Price)

First thing you'll notice: they give you 10 free proxies. Forever. No credit card, no "trial period that secretly charges you." Just 10 proxies with 1GB bandwidth per month that you can use indefinitely. That's actually useful if you're just testing stuff out or running small projects.

The real story here is the pricing. We're talking $2.99/month for 100 datacenter proxies. That's less than a coffee at Starbucks. But before you think "cheap means garbage," hold up—their success rates are hovering around 90-99%, depending on what you're scraping.

### The Speed Thing

They claim speeds up to 950 Mbps on datacenter proxies. I've seen tests showing 800-950 Mbps consistently, which is... actually pretty damn fast. Not going to lie, that's faster than my home internet. Their residential proxies are slower (obviously), but still respectable.

And here's something nobody talks about: 99.97% uptime. That translates to about 2.6 hours of downtime per year. For context, that's better than most hosting providers I've used.

## Let's Talk About What You Actually Get

Webshare offers three main proxy types, and they're all pretty straightforward:

**Datacenter Proxies** — These are the budget option. Fast, cheap, but easier to detect. Perfect for basic scraping, price monitoring, or managing multiple accounts where you don't need residential IPs.

**Static Residential Proxies** — These come from real ISPs like AT&T and Sprint. You get the same IP every time, which is great for tasks that need consistency. They're faster than rotating residential proxies and harder to block than datacenter ones. It's the middle ground.

**Rotating Residential Proxies** — The heavy hitters. 80 million+ real residential IPs that rotate automatically. These are for when you need to look like a regular person browsing from home. Currently running a 50% off promo, which makes them $1.40/GB instead of $2.80/GB.

## Pricing Breakdown (Because That's What You Really Want)

Here's where it gets interesting. Webshare has this tiered pricing thing where the more you buy, the cheaper it gets per proxy. It's simple economics, but they're pretty transparent about it.

The yearly plans save you 30-60% compared to monthly. If you know you'll use the service long-term, it's a no-brainer.

## Real Talk: What Works and What Doesn't

I've spent way too much time reading user reviews (because apparently that's my life now), and here's the pattern I'm seeing:

**What people love:**
- The pricing. Everyone mentions this. It's significantly cheaper than Bright Data or Oxylabs
- The free tier actually being useful, not just a marketing gimmick
- High success rates for datacenter proxies (90%+)
- The dashboard is clean and doesn't require a PhD to navigate
- Customer support responds within a day, which is... acceptable

**What people complain about:**
- Support is email-only. No live chat, no phone. If you need instant help, you're out of luck
- Geographic targeting isn't as granular as some competitors
- The residential proxy pool, while large, isn't as massive as Bright Data's 72 million
- Some users report occasional slow response times during peak hours

One guy on TrustPilot mentioned making 20 million requests per month with a 90%+ success rate and zero downtime. Another user said they've been using it for three years straight. That's the kind of boring consistency you want from a proxy service.

## Who Actually Benefits From This?

Let me break this down by use case, because "everyone" is not a useful answer:

**Web Scrapers** — If you're pulling data from e-commerce sites, hotel prices, or pretty much anything that doesn't have super aggressive anti-bot measures, Webshare's datacenter proxies will do the job. For more protected sites, go with the residential ones.

**SEO People** — Track rankings, scrape SERPs, monitor competitors. The rotating residential proxies work great here because you can check rankings from different locations without getting flagged.

**Social Media Managers** — Managing multiple accounts? Static residential proxies are your friend. Same IP every time means platforms don't freak out about "suspicious activity."

**Market Researchers** — Need to check competitor pricing across regions? Webshare's got IPs in 195 countries. That's literally every country. You can pretend to be shopping from anywhere.

**Privacy-Conscious Browsers** — If you just want to browse the web anonymously, the 10 free proxies are actually enough for casual use. No credit card required.

## The Technical Stuff (For People Who Care)

Webshare supports both HTTP and SOCKS5 protocols. You can authenticate via username/password or IP whitelist. The dashboard shows real-time stats—bandwidth usage, active connections, error rates. It's all there.

They have a Chrome extension that's actually rated 4.2/5 stars, which is pretty good for a proxy extension. Makes it super easy to switch locations without manually configuring anything.

The API documentation is solid if you're a developer. Clear endpoints, good examples, actually works as documented (shocking, I know).

Response times average under 100ms for most regions, which is fast enough that you won't notice any lag.

## The 2026 Promo Situation

Right now (January 2026), they're running a 50% off promotion on rotating residential proxies. This brings the price down to $1.40/GB from $2.80/GB, which is actually competitive with mid-tier providers.

There's also a 30% discount on yearly datacenter plans, which stacks on top of the volume discounts. So you could get 60,000 proxies for $0.0144 per proxy if you go yearly, which is absurdly cheap.

I can't promise these deals will last forever. Promo codes in the proxy world come and go, but the pricing structure tends to stay competitive.

## How It Compares to Alternatives

**vs. Bright Data** — Bright Data has more features, better support, more IPs. It also costs 3-5x more. If you need enterprise-grade with all the bells and whistles, go Bright Data. If you need "works well enough for way less money," that's Webshare.

**vs. Smartproxy** — Smartproxy is in a similar price range but has fewer datacenter locations. Webshare wins on pure affordability for datacenter proxies. Smartproxy edges ahead on customer support quality.

**vs. Oxylabs** — Funny story: Oxylabs bought Webshare in 2022, but they operate independently. Oxylabs is the premium tier, Webshare is the value tier. Different use cases, different budgets.

## The Bottom Line

Here's what it comes down to: Webshare isn't trying to be the fanciest proxy service with every feature imaginable. They're trying to be the reliable, affordable option that actually works.

For small to medium businesses, individual developers, or anyone who doesn't have an enterprise budget, Webshare delivers solid performance at prices that won't make your accountant cry.

The 99.97% uptime is legit. The speeds are fast. The pricing is transparent (no hidden fees or "contact us for pricing" nonsense). And you can test it with 10 free proxies before spending a dime.

Is it perfect? No. The email-only support can be slow if you hit an urgent issue. The IP pool isn't as large as some competitors. But for what most people actually need? It gets the job done.

👉 [**Start with 10 Free Proxies — No Credit Card Required**](https://webshare.io)

I know that sounds like a sales pitch, but honestly, the free tier is actually useful for testing. Try it out, see if it works for your use case, then decide if you want to pay for more.

## Quick FAQ (The Stuff People Always Ask)

**Can I really use it for free?**
Yes. 10 proxies, 1GB bandwidth per month, forever. No credit card. They're not going to suddenly charge you.

**What's the refund policy?**
Two days from purchase, under 1GB bandwidth used, fewer than 1,000 proxies used. Email support@webshare.io. Pretty standard.

**Do they work for Netflix/streaming?**
The residential proxies might work for some streaming services, but Webshare doesn't officially support or guarantee this. It's hit or miss.

**How fast is "fast"?**
Datacenter proxies: 800-950 Mbps. Static residential: up to 1 Gbps. Rotating residential: slower, but still decent for most tasks.

**Can I use them for sneaker bots?**
Technically yes, but datacenter proxies will get blocked on most sneaker sites. You'd need residential ones, and even then, success isn't guaranteed.

Look, at the end of the day, proxy services are boring infrastructure. You want them to work reliably and not cost a fortune. Webshare does both of those things pretty well. That's really all there is to it.

No fluff, no hype. Just proxies that work at prices that make sense. Sometimes that's exactly what you need.
